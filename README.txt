Created August 2025

Welcome to the frontend code of a poet's portfolio website found at
	sloanporterpoetry.com

As of 2025, the frontend is being hosted on Netlify. 
For information about the backend, go to www.github.com/sloanware/sloanporterpoetry-website-backend.

The frontend was developed using vanilla HTML/CSS/JS after a HTML5up free template.
All photos and graphics were designed by yours truly.

P.S. The books listed on the website are absolutely real ;)
